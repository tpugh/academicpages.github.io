Education
======
I started my graduate studies at Norfolk State University where I studied computer science while balancing my duties as a full-scholarship athlete. Balancing playing football and excelling in my computer science studies instilled in me a strong work ethic and discipline that I still strive to use today. After graduating with my bachelor's, I decided to start the master's program where I studied as a CyberCorps scholar. This program provides scholarships for up to 3 years of support for cybersecurity undergraduate and graduate (MS or Ph.D.) education. After earning my master's I started to work full-time as a software engineer and later started at Towson Universityâ€™s doctoral program where I research AI/ML. 

Devs Like Us
======
During the 2020 pandemic, I co-founded The Devs Like Us community with two of my long-time friends from school. This community was established to provide a supportive group for developers of all kinds with a focus on diversity, minorities, and resources to increase entry, retention, and success within the technical workforce.In support of this effort, I help produce and participate in a podcast, produce educational content and tutorials, and write the Devs Like Us newsletter.
