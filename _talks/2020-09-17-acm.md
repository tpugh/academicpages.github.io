One of the biggest obstacles to widespread adoption of an application is user familiarity. If users donâ€™t know how to take advantage of all the features of your application,
they might stop using it entirely! But what if the users could simply and easily train themselves? In this talk, Terrence will introduce SkillTree, an open source solution for gamifying user training. A product of a larger government initiative to move toward open source coding practices, SkillTree creates a rewards system that awards users skill points for executing defined actions in your application. It can be easily integrated into an existing application and quickly configured by the
development team. In early deployments, SkillTree has dramatically increased user engagement and utilization of application features and generated significant cost savings
over traditional training methods.
